# Things that I want to do, but would put me past my deadline:

* I could remove the --cov-config with a small patch to pytest-cov
    use os.path.abspath(options.cov_config) in postprocess(options)

* coverage.py adds some helpful warnings to stderr, with no way to quiet them.
    there's already an issue (#2 i think?), just needs a patch

* pytest-timeout won't actually time-out with floating-point, zero, or negative input


* Make doubly sure these test scenarios are covered:
   * entirely clean -- <venv_path> does not exist
   * noop -- Requirements haven't changed since last run
   * each of these should behave similarly whether caused by the user or the requirements file:
       * upgrade
       * downgrade
       * add
       * delete

* pypy support. Some icky subprocess bugs makes it impossible to make not-flakey:
    * https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/issue/1910/fdopen-of-pty-doesnt-match-cpython
    * https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/issue/1912/subprocess-deadlock-in-pypy3

* fixture to delete all PIP* environment vars before starting tests
